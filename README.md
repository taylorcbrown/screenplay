# Screenplay

This is a test open source screenplay. The idea:

The owner writes their screenplay in Fountain, then pushes changes when they crack sections of the script. If someone else wants to work on it they could fork the screenplay and submit their changes. The owner would review the proposed changes and incorporate them if they work.

Imagine WordPress, but as a screenplay.
